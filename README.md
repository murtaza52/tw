## Instructions

The app can be run by starting the repl. It calls the (assemble-tracks) fn in the tw.core ns, which processes the input and prints the output on the nrepl.

It can also be re-run by calling the (assemble-tracks) fn in the repl.

This app uses the midje library for running tests. It uses one of the midje conventions, which allows mixing of the tests with the code. This allows for much more readable code.
